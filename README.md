# Mini Project #1 - Sorting Shakespeare’s complete works Algorithms and Data Structures

We also have included a heap sort that takes any type of parameter so its able to not only sort strings but also doubles and ints in this project.

## Requirements 

- C# (Visual Studio 19).


## Setup Guide
- Download the folder and open it with Visual Studio
- Go to the program folder and change the path of the txt file 

```c#
 ReadTxtFile readTxtFile = new ReadTxtFile("YOUR LOCATION OF THE SHAKESPEARE TEXT DOKUMENT");
```
- Run program

## Result

We have implemented the five different sorting algorithms Selection, Insertion, Merge, Heap and Trie sort. below you see the result of each algorithm going through and sorting all complete works of Shakespeare.

- Trie sort with timing test ~ 00:00:00.5325465
- Heap sort with timing test ~ 00:00:00.8853860
- Merge sort timing test ~ 00:00:03.5317335
- Insertions sort timing test ~ Too slow 
- Selection sort timing test ~ Too slow
